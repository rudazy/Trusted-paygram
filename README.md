## What Is This?

Traditional payroll systems expose sensitive financial data at every layer. Employers see everyone's salary. Payment processors see transaction amounts. Blockchains make it worse: every balance and transfer is public by default.

**Trusted PayGram** solves this with Fully Homomorphic Encryption. Salaries, trust scores, and payment amounts are encrypted end-to-end. The smart contracts compute on ciphertext directly. Nobody sees the numbers, but the math still works.

The system adds a second layer: **trust-gated payment routing**. Each employee has an encrypted reputation score derived from EigenTrust. High-trust employees receive instant payments. Medium-trust employees have a 24-hour delay. Low-trust or new employees go through milestone-gated escrow. The routing decision happens entirely under encryption.

Three contracts, one coprocessor, zero plaintext.

## Trust-Gated Payment Flows

| Tier | Score Range | Routing | Release Mechanism |
|:-----|:-----------|:--------|:------------------|
| **HIGH** | 75 - 100 | Instant encrypted transfer | Immediate |
| **MEDIUM** | 40 - 74 | 24-hour delayed release | Automatic after time lock |
| **LOW** | 0 - 39 | Milestone-gated escrow | Manual employer approval |
| **Unscored** | N/A | Defaults to escrow | Manual employer approval |

The routing decision is fully oblivious. All three payment paths execute on every payroll run, but only the correct path carries a non-zero encrypted amount:

```solidity
function _processWithTrustTier(Employee storage emp) internal {
    ebool isHigh = trustScoring.isHighTrust(emp.wallet);
    ebool isMed  = trustScoring.isMediumTrust(emp.wallet);

    euint64 zero = FHE.asEuint64(0);

    // Oblivious routing: exactly one path carries the salary
    euint64 instantAmt = FHE.select(isHigh, emp.encryptedSalary, zero);
    euint64 remaining  = FHE.sub(emp.encryptedSalary, instantAmt);
    euint64 delayedAmt = FHE.select(isMed, remaining, zero);
    euint64 escrowAmt  = FHE.sub(remaining, delayedAmt);

    _processInstantPayment(emp.wallet, instantAmt);
    _processDelayedPayment(emp.wallet, delayedAmt);
    _processEscrowPaymentEncrypted(emp.wallet, escrowAmt);
}
```

No `if` statements. No branching on decrypted values. The coprocessor evaluates `FHE.select` on ciphertext, and the chain never learns which tier an employee belongs to.

## Privacy Model

### What's Encrypted

- [x] Employee salary amounts (stored as `euint64`)
- [x] Trust reputation scores (stored as `euint64`)
- [x] Trust tier classification (computed via `FHE.select`, never decrypted on-chain)
- [x] Token balances (ERC-7984 encrypted balances)
- [x] Transfer amounts (confidential transfers between contract and employees)
- [x] Payment routing decision (oblivious branching, no plaintext conditionals)

### Who Can See What

| Data | Employer | Employee | Public | Contract |
|:-----|:--------:|:--------:|:------:|:--------:|
| Salary amount | Granted | Own only | No | Yes |
| Trust score | Granted | Own only | No | Yes |
| Trust tier | No | No | No | Computed |
| Token balance | No | Own only | No | Yes |
| Payment status | Yes | Own only | Event only | Yes |
| Employee roster | Yes | No | Events | Yes |
| Payment timing | Yes | Own only | Events | Yes |

"Granted" means the address holds an FHE decryption grant issued via `FHE.allow()`. "Computed" means the value is used in encrypted computation but never materialized as plaintext.

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with gas reporting
REPORT_GAS=true npm test

# Run specific test file
npx hardhat test test/TrustScoring.test.ts

# Run only non-FHE tests (no coprocessor needed)
npx hardhat test --grep "should"
```

Tests are structured with a `try/catch + this.skip()` pattern: non-FHE logic runs on vanilla Hardhat, and FHE-dependent tests are automatically skipped when the coprocessor is unavailable.

**112 tests passing** (98 FHE-pending, awaiting coprocessor integration).

## Key Innovations

1. **Oblivious payment routing** &mdash; Trust tier evaluation and salary routing happen entirely under FHE. The contract executes all three payment paths on every payroll run; `FHE.select` ensures only the correct path carries value. No observer can determine which tier an employee falls into.

2. **EigenTrust reputation on-chain** &mdash; Encrypted reputation scores are submitted by authorized oracles and stored as `euint64`. Tier boundaries are evaluated with `FHE.ge` comparisons that never reveal the underlying score, even to the contract owner.

3. **Batch payroll with bounded gas** &mdash; A single `executePayroll()` processes up to 50 employees per transaction. Each employee requires exactly 3 FHE operations for tier evaluation plus 3 payment record writes, keeping gas predictable.

4. **ERC-7984 observer access** &mdash; The `ObserverAccess` extension allows employers to set an observer on employee token accounts for payroll auditing. Observers can verify encrypted disbursements without accessing other employees' data.

5. **Escrow with milestone gating** &mdash; Low-trust and unscored employees receive payments into escrow. The employer must explicitly approve release, providing a dispute resolution mechanism without exposing payment amounts.
